OWA-Unread-Message-Count
========================

I found myself annoyed by the Outlook Web App because one has to actually click 
on the OWA tab to see if you have any messages. With this extension, one can work 
in other tabs and know if they have any messages waiting for them or not.

This extension currently only works with the OWA URL format */owa/*
